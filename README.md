COSC3026-Final_Project
======================

This is our team's final project for the Introduction to Game Design course at Laurentian University.

Most of us are new to the tools we're using, and we're all new to game design in general. Please go easy

Current state: Work continues on a private repository. Once complete, the code may be re-merged into this repo for further development.
